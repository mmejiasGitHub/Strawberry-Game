# Strawberry Game
The Strawberry game also known as ColorGenBerry was created by Miguel Mejias Amparo. Its mission is based on performing concentration exercises by playing a short game where the player can concentrate, perform one or two tasks at a time, count numbers, distract themselves to voluntarily change the focus of attention from their thoughts and sensations to another stimulus that allows them to reduce anxiety and train attention. In the game, the player will have control of a strawberry. This strawberry will go up or down depending on what the player decides. The strawberry's objective is to reach the finish line, but in order to get there, the player will have to help the strawberry on its journey, avoiding the obstacles that are in the way, and freely, depending on the player, collecting extra coins every time the strawberry makes contact with another strawberry of a similar color.
